# Project Playground

Concepts that are considered here
- use pnpm and the pnpm workspaces
- Using types / interfaces for server and client
- Server loads sample data from json file
- Use services in client that implement an interface to handle a resource's api and lists
- Services are tested with jest
- Components for item and list respect their responsibilities. List handles list, item handles item.
- InPlace editing for updates
